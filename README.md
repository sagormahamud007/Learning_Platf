# . ### First I install the React Router DOM application, then I finish the React Router definition.
# . ###I have used firebase authentication in this project, for that I have to go to firebase and install their application and do the login and register correctly as shown by them.
# . ### Then I entered the fake data on the server site and displayed that data on my site using React Hook, then clicking on all that data will show the details.
# . ### I have designed a 404 page, if someone writes something wrong in the URL, then that page will show., then I have designed the home page, then if someone goes to the details page, from there they can download the details page as PDF. , the name of the user will be displayed if the mouse is taken over the user's picture
# . ### Applications used in this project include React Bootstrap Framework, React Router DOM, Firebase,Deploying this project to Firebase, along with that I have also deployed the server site

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
